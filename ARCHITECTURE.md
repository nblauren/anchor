# Anchor — Architecture

**Last Updated**: March 2026
**Version**: 1.0.0

---

## Overview

Anchor is an offline-first, peer-to-peer proximity chat app for gay cruises, festivals, beaches, and events. It uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for device discovery, profile broadcasting, messaging, and photo transfer — entirely without internet connectivity.

**Design Philosophy:**

| Principle | Description |
|---|---|
| Local-First | All data stored on-device via SQLite (Drift); no servers, no cloud |
| Privacy by Design | No accounts, no tracking; users control all data |
| Minimal Broadcast | Only essential, ID-mapped profile fields broadcast over BLE |
| Safety Gate | NSFW detection runs locally before any photo is allowed to broadcast |
| Consent-Based Photos | Full photo transfer requires explicit receiver acceptance |
| Battery Conscious | Adaptive scanning intervals, connection pooling, battery saver mode |
| Feature-Based Structure | Self-contained feature modules for maintainability |

---

## Architecture Pattern

Anchor follows **Clean Architecture** with a **Feature-Based** organisation:

```
Presentation Layer  (Flutter Widgets + Bloc)
        ↓ events / ↑ states
Domain / Business Logic Layer  (Bloc handlers, repositories)
        ↓ calls
Data / Service Layer  (Drift DB, BLE service, image service)
```

Key principles:
1. **Separation of concerns** — each layer has a single responsibility
2. **Dependency inversion** — high-level modules depend on abstractions (`BleServiceInterface`), not implementations
3. **Unidirectional data flow** — events flow up to Blocs; states flow back down to widgets
4. **Testability** — `MockBleService` substitutes for real BLE in unit/widget tests

> **Note**: `flutter_blue_plus_ble_service.dart` is named for historical reasons but actually uses the `bluetooth_low_energy` package, which provides both Central and Peripheral managers in a single API.

---

## BLE Communication Protocol

### Package

Anchor uses **`bluetooth_low_energy`** (not `flutter_blue_plus`). This package provides:
- `CentralManager` — scanning and connecting to peripherals
- `PeripheralManager` — GATT server and advertising

Both roles run simultaneously on the same device, enabling true peer-to-peer discovery.

### Service and Characteristic UUIDs

```
Main Service:           0000fff0-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb

Characteristics:
  fff1  Profile metadata    READ, NOTIFY   name, age, position ID, interest IDs, userId
  fff2  Primary thumbnail   READ, NOTIFY   JPEG bytes, 10–30 KB
  fff3  Messaging           WRITE, NOTIFY  JSON-encoded messages (text, photo events, anchor drop)
  fff4  Full photo set      READ           On-demand; serves all profile thumbnails concatenated
```

### Discovery Protocol

```
Device A (Central)                         Device B (Peripheral)
      |                                           |
      |-- scan for fff0 service UUID ------------>|
      |<-- advertisement (fff0 + local name) -----|
      |                                           |
      |-- GATT connect -------------------------->|
      |-- read fff1 (profile metadata) ---------->|
      |<-- { userId, name, age, positionId,       |
      |       interestIds, hopCount } ------------|
      |-- read fff2 (primary thumbnail) --------->|
      |<-- JPEG bytes (≤30 KB) ------------------|
      |                                           |
      |  emit DiscoveredPeer to stream            |
      |  (DiscoveryBloc updates grid)             |
      |                                           |
      |-- disconnect (idle after 60 s) ---------->|
```

**Peer timeout**: If no GATT activity is observed for the configured `peerLostTimeout` (default 2 minutes), a `peerLost` event is emitted and the peer is marked out-of-range in the UI.

### Messaging Protocol

```
Sender (Central)                           Receiver (Peripheral / GATT server)
      |                                           |
      |-- connect (if not already) ------------->|
      |-- subscribe to fff3 NOTIFY ------------->|
      |-- write to fff3 (JSON payload) --------->|
      |                                           |
      |   { messageId, senderId, timestamp,       |
      |     type, content, ttl? }                 |
      |                                           |
      |                         messageReceived stream emits
      |                         ChatBloc saves to DB, updates UI
```

Message types (`MessageType` enum): `text`, `photo`, `typing`, `read`, `photoPreview`, `photoRequest`, `wifiTransferReady`

**Store-and-forward for direct messages**: Undelivered messages (status `pending` or `failed`) are persisted in the `messages` table. `StoreAndForwardService` monitors peer discovery events and retries queued messages when a peer is rediscovered, incrementing `retry_count` and updating `last_attempt_at` on each attempt.

### Photo Transfer Protocol

Photo sharing uses a consent-first flow with Wi-Fi Direct high-speed transfer:

```
Step 1 — Preview notification (Sender → Receiver via BLE fff3)
  { type: "photoPreview", messageId, photoId, originalSize }
  Note: No thumbnail data is sent — the receiver sees "Photo — Tap to download"

Step 2 — Consent request (Receiver → Sender via BLE fff3)
  { type: "photoRequest", photoId, accepted: true }

Step 3 — Full photo transfer (Wi-Fi Direct preferred, BLE fallback)
  a. Sender starts Nearby Connections advertising
  b. Sender sends wifiTransferReady BLE signal with sender's Nearby ID
  c. Receiver starts browsing → discovers → invites → connects
  d. Sender streams base64-encoded chunks over Wi-Fi Direct text channel
  e. If Wi-Fi Direct times out (15 s), sender falls back to BLE chunking via fff3

Step 4 — Transfer complete
  Receiver saves photo, upgrades preview bubble to full photo in UI
```

**Wi-Fi Direct Transfer (`HighSpeedTransferService`):**
- Uses `flutter_nearby_connections_plus` (Google Nearby Connections API / Multipeer Connectivity)
- Sender = ADVERTISER, Receiver = BROWSER (coordinated via BLE signal)
- Binary data base64-encoded and split into 24 KB chunks (~32 KB base64)
- 5 MB photo transfers in < 1 second over Wi-Fi Direct vs. ~3 min over BLE
- One concurrent transfer at a time; NearbyService reinitializes between transfers

**Constraints:**
- Full photo transfer is **direct peer-to-peer only** — multi-hop relay for photos is not supported
- Compressed target size: ≤200 KB JPEG
- Progress updates emitted via `photoProgressStream` (BLE) or `transferProgressStream` (Wi-Fi Direct)
- Transfer can be cancelled by either party
- Two separate ID systems: BLE device IDs vs app userIds — mapped via `_transferToBleId` in ChatBloc

### Mesh Relay Protocol

For text messages, Anchor implements a **TTL-based flooding** relay:

```
Original sender sets TTL (default 3).
Each relay node:
  1. Checks message deduplication cache (messageId already seen → drop).
  2. Decrements TTL; if TTL == 0 → drop.
  3. Forwards to all currently connected peers (excluding the sender).
```

**Important constraints:**
- Relay is **not** store-and-forward — a node only relays to peers that are currently connected
- Photos are **never** relayed; only text-type messages are eligible for mesh relay
- Relay is toggled via `BleConnectionBloc` → `SetMeshRelay` event
- In high-density environments, relay probability is throttled (`highDensityRelayProbability = 0.65`)

### Connection Management

| Parameter | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Max concurrent connections | 5 | Configurable in `BleConfig` |
| Connection timeout | 30 s | GATT connect attempt timeout |
| Idle disconnect | 60 s | Drop connections with no recent activity |
| Peer lost timeout | 2 min | Emit `peerLost` if no GATT activity |
| Normal scan duration | 5 s | Active scan window |
| Normal scan pause | 15 s | Pause between scans |
| Battery saver scan duration | 2 s | |
| Battery saver scan pause | 30 s | |

**Adaptive scanning**: In high-density mode (≥15 visible peers), scan pause increases (`highDensityScanPause`) and relay probability is reduced to limit mesh traffic.

## Profile Data Model

### Broadcast Payload (over BLE)

| Field | Type | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| `userId` | UUID string | Stable per-install identifier |
| `name` | string | Nickname, user-set |
| `age` | int | User-set |
| `positionId` | int | Maps to a fixed list of position labels |
| `interestIds` | List\<int\> | Maps to a fixed interest label set; no free-text interests |
| `hopCount` | int | 0 = direct; >0 = relayed |
| Primary thumbnail | JPEG bytes | ≤30 KB; screened for NSFW before broadcast |

Position IDs and interest IDs are defined in `lib/core/constants/profile_constants.dart`. Using integer IDs keeps the broadcast payload compact and prevents injection of arbitrary text into the mesh.

### Local-Only Profile Fields

The following are stored locally and never broadcast over BLE:
- Bio / extended description
- Additional photos (up to 4 total)
- Block list

### NSFW Detection Flow

```
User selects photo (gallery or camera)
        ↓
ImageService compresses to thumbnail (≤30 KB)
        ↓
NsfwDetectionService.classify(thumbnailBytes)
        ↓
  NSFW score too high?
  ├── Yes → ProfileBloc emits nsfwBlockedPhotoId
  │         Photo stored locally but not broadcast
  │         UI prompts user to choose a different photo
  └── No  → Photo approved; set as primary thumbnail
             broadcastProfile() includes thumbnail bytes
```

---

## State Management (Bloc Pattern)

### Why Bloc

- Clean separation of business logic and UI
- Predictable, testable state transitions
- Strong event/state typing with Equatable
- Bloc DevTools integration for debugging

### Key Blocs

**`ProfileBloc`** (`lib/features/profile/bloc/profile_bloc.dart`)
- Manages the user's own profile
- Key events: `LoadProfile`, `CreateProfile`, `UpdateProfile`, `AddPhoto`, `RemovePhoto`, `SetPrimaryPhoto`, `BroadcastProfile`, `DismissNsfwWarning`
- Handles NSFW detection result routing and photo ordering

**`DiscoveryBloc`** (`lib/features/discovery/bloc/discovery_bloc.dart`)
- Listens to BLE `peerDiscovered` / `peerLost` streams
- Filters blocked users
- Applies position and interest filters (local, zero-network)
- Manages anchor drop send/receive events
- Key events: `StartDiscovery`, `StopDiscovery`, `PeerDiscovered`, `PeerLost`, `BlockPeer`, `SetPositionFilter`, `ToggleInterestFilter`, `DropAnchorOnPeer`

**`ChatBloc`** (`lib/features/chat/bloc/chat_bloc.dart`)
- Manages conversations and messages
- Listens to `messageReceived` stream from BLE service
- Handles photo consent flow: `PhotoPreviewReceived` → `RequestFullPhoto` → `PhotoTransferProgressUpdated`
- **Non-blocking send queue**: `SendTextMessage` and `SendPhotoMessage` save to DB and update UI immediately, then send via BLE in the background using a FIFO queue (`_sendQueue`). Input is never blocked.
- **Emoji reactions**: `SendReaction` / `ReactionReceived` events; cannot react to own message
- **Reply-to**: `SendTextMessage` and `SendPhotoMessage` accept optional `replyToMessageId`
- **Read receipts**: `MarkMessagesRead` emits BLE read-receipt; `ReadReceiptReceived` updates message status to `read`
- Wi-Fi Direct integration: `WifiTransferReadyReceived` triggers Nearby browsing; `NearbyPayloadCompleted` handles received photos; `_transferToBleId` map resolves Nearby userIds to BLE device IDs
- Key events: `SendTextMessage`, `SendPhotoMessage`, `BleMessageReceived`, `PhotoPreviewReceived`, `RequestFullPhoto`, `PhotoRequestReceived`, `CancelPhotoTransfer`, `WifiTransferReadyReceived`, `NearbyPayloadCompleted`, `RegisterPendingOutgoingPhoto`, `SendReaction`, `ReactionReceived`, `MarkMessagesRead`, `ReadReceiptReceived`

**`BleStatusBloc`** (`lib/services/ble/ble_status_bloc.dart`)
- Tracks Bluetooth adapter state (enabled / disabled / unavailable)
- Tracks runtime permission status
- Triggers permission requests

**`BleConnectionBloc`** (`lib/services/ble/ble_connection_bloc.dart`)
- Manages BLE service lifecycle (initialize, start/stop scanning, start/stop broadcasting)
- Handles app foreground/background transitions
- Exposes `SetBatterySaver` and `SetMeshRelay` toggle events

## Data Layer

### Drift Database Schema

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `user_profiles` | The device owner's profile (single row) |
| `user_photos` | Photos attached to the user's profile (up to 4) |
| `discovered_peers` | Cached peer profiles read from BLE (includes `userId` for MAC rotation dedup) |
| `conversations` | 1:1 chat conversations |
| `messages` | Chat messages; includes `retry_count`, `last_attempt_at` (store-and-forward) and `reply_to_message_id` (reply-to) |
| `blocked_users` | Locally blocked peer IDs |
| `anchor_drops` | History of sent/received anchor drop signals |
| `message_reactions` | Emoji reactions on messages (sender, emoji, timestamp) |

**Schema version**: 8

| Migration | Change |
|---|---|
| v1 → v2 | Full schema recreate (dropped old tables) |
| v2 → v3 | Add `anchor_drops` table |
| v3 → v4 | Add `position` and `interests` columns to `user_profiles` and `discovered_peers` |
| v4 → v5 | Add `user_id` to `discovered_peers` (stable ID for BLE MAC rotation dedup) |
| v5 → v6 | Add `message_reactions` table |
| v6 → v7 | Add `retry_count` and `last_attempt_at` to `messages` (store-and-forward) |
| v7 → v8 | Add `reply_to_message_id` to `messages` (reply-to) |

All writes go through repositories; Blocs never access the database directly.

### Repositories

| Repository | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `ProfileRepository` | CRUD for own profile and photos |
| `PeerRepository` | Store/update/query discovered peers; block management |
| `ChatRepository` | Conversations, messages, unread counts, status updates, reactions |
| `AnchorDropRepository` | Persist and query anchor drop history |

---

## Feature Modules

### Profile (`lib/features/profile/`)

- Create and edit profile: nickname, age, position (ID), interests (IDs), up to 4 photos
- Primary photo selection with NSFW gate
- Profile preview widget (shows exactly what others see)

## Platform Differences

### iOS

| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| Minimum version | iOS 14.0 |
| Background BLE | Severely limited; discovery stops when app is backgrounded (Apple restriction) |
| Background modes | `bluetooth-central`, `bluetooth-peripheral` declared but OS throttles aggressively |
| Connection limit | ~8–10 concurrent |
| GATT MTU | Typically 185 bytes |
| Onboarding note | Users are informed about the foreground requirement during onboarding |

### Android

| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| Minimum SDK | API 26 (Android 8.0) |
| Background BLE | Supported via `FOREGROUND_SERVICE`; displays a persistent notification |
| Connection limit | 20–50 concurrent (device-dependent) |
| GATT MTU | Negotiable up to 512 bytes |
| Android 12+ | Requires `BLUETOOTH_SCAN`, `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT`, `BLUETOOTH_ADVERTISE` permissions |

---

## Battery Optimization

### Adaptive Scanning

| Mode | Scan Duration | Pause | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Normal | 5 s | 15 s | Default |
| Battery Saver | 2 s | 30 s | User-toggled in Settings |
| High Density (auto) | 5 s | 12 s | Auto-engaged when ≥15 peers visible; relay probability reduced to 0.65 |

### Connection Pooling

- Maximum 5 concurrent connections (LRU eviction)
- Active chat connections are prioritised over idle discovery connections
- Idle connections are dropped after 60 seconds of no activity

### Photo Thumbnail Budget

Primary thumbnails are capped at 30 KB and compressed by `ImageService` before being written to the `fff2` characteristic. This limits both broadcast size and battery cost of serving thumbnails to scanning peers.

---

## Privacy & Safety

### Data Residency

- 100% local: SQLite on-device via Drift
- No network calls, no analytics, no telemetry
- Uninstalling the app permanently deletes all data

### BLE Broadcast Minimisation

- Only integer IDs (not free text) for position and interests — prevents arbitrary text injection into the mesh and keeps payload size small
- Primary photo screened by on-device NSFW classifier before broadcast is permitted
- No GPS coordinates broadcast or stored; BLE RSSI gives approximate proximity only

### Message Security

| Status | Detail |
|---|---|
| v1 (current) | BLE GATT messages are **not encrypted**; anyone with Anchor in range could theoretically intercept |
| v2 (planned) | End-to-end encryption using public key pairs generated at first launch; keys exchanged during BLE discovery |

### User Controls

- Block any peer locally at any time
- Blocked peers: cannot discover you, cannot message you, are hidden from your grid
- Visibility can be toggled (stop broadcasting)

---

## Error Handling

**`AppError` hierarchy** (`lib/core/errors/app_error.dart`):

```dart
abstract class AppError implements Exception {
  String get userMessage;  // shown to user
  String get code;         // for logging/debugging
  bool get isRecoverable;  // controls Retry vs OK button
}

// Concrete types:
class BleError extends AppError { … }
class DatabaseError extends AppError { … }
class PermissionError extends AppError { … }
class ImageError extends AppError { … }
class ProfileError extends AppError { … }
class ChatError extends AppError { … }
class DiscoveryError extends AppError { … }
```

Error UI components: `ErrorStateWidget` (full-screen), inline banners, SnackBar toasts.

---

## Logging

`Logger` utility (`lib/core/utils/logger.dart`):

```dart
Logger.info('Discovered peer: $name', 'BLE');
Logger.warning('Relay TTL exhausted', 'BLE');
Logger.error('Connection failed', 'BLE', error);
Logger.debug('Thumbnail bytes: ${bytes.length}', 'BLE');
```

Logs are viewable in real time via **Settings → Debug Menu → View Logs**.

---

## Dependency Injection

**GetIt** service locator (`lib/injection.dart`):

```dart
void setupDependencies(BleConfig config) {
  getIt.registerLazySingleton<DatabaseService>(() => DatabaseService());
  getIt.registerLazySingleton<ImageService>(() => ImageService());

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- **Repositories**: In-memory Drift database; test CRUD, constraints, edge cases
- **Blocs**: Mock repositories and services; assert state transitions and stream emissions
- **Services**: `MockBleService` for BLE-dependent logic without hardware

### Integration Tests

- Discovery flow: init service → start scan → emit mock `DiscoveredPeer` → verify `DiscoveryBloc` state → verify DB write → verify UI
- Messaging flow: discover peer → open chat → send message → verify DB → mock `messageReceived` → verify UI
- Photo consent flow: emit `photoPreview` → user accepts → emit `photoRequest` → emit progress → verify completion

### Device Tests

> BLE requires physical hardware. Minimum: 2 devices.

| Scenario | Pass Criteria |
|---|---|
| Discovery | Both devices appear in each other's grid within 10 s |
| Text message | Delivers in ≤3 s when in range |
| Photo consent | Preview shown; accept triggers transfer; progress displayed |
| NSFW photo | Blocked before broadcast; UI shows warning |
| Permissions denied | Error shown; Settings link works; app recovers on grant |
| 5+ peers | All discover each other; connection pool respected; no crashes |
| Battery saver | Reduced scan frequency confirmed in debug logs |
| Mesh relay | Message reaches peer via intermediate node (requires 3 devices) |

---

## Future Enhancements (Planned)

| Feature | Notes |
|---|---|
| End-to-end encryption | RSA key pair per device; keys exchanged during BLE discovery |
| Group chat | Broadcast messages to multiple peers; group formation via QR/event code |
| Voice messages | Record, compress, chunk, transfer over BLE or Wi-Fi Direct |
| Photo albums | Multiple photos per message; gallery view |
| Event codes | Organiser-generated code to scope discovery to event attendees |
| Concurrent Wi-Fi Direct transfers | Support multiple simultaneous photo transfers |
